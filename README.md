## AI/ML/DL Projects

#### This repository contains three projects that utilize AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for financial market analysis and trading. Each project is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of various AI/ML/DL applications in trading and financial predictions.

### Projects Overview

#### 1. Cryptocurrency Price Prediction (crypto.py)
#### This project focuses on predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies using machine learning algorithms.

### Features:
#### Data collection and preprocessing from cryptocurrency APIs.
#### Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
#### Evaluation of model performance and prediction accuracy.
#### Visualization of price trends and predictions.



#### 2. Stock Price Analysis (stock.py)
#### This project aims to analyze and predict stock prices using deep learning techniques.

### Features:
##### Data extraction and preprocessing from stock market APIs.
#### Use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for time series forecasting.
#### Training and validation of the LSTM model.
#### Visualization of historical stock prices and prediction results.



#### 3. Trading Bot (tradingbot.py)
#### This project involves the creation of an automated trading bot that makes buy/sell decisions based on predicted prices.

### Features:
#### Integration with cryptocurrency and stock market APIs for real-time data.
#### Implementation of trading strategies based on ML/DL model predictions.
#### Automated execution of trades on simulated or live markets.
#### Logging and analysis of trading performance.
